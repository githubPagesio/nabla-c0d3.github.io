  <h3><a href="http://isecpartners.github.io/Introspy-iOS/">Introspy</a></h3>
  <p>Open-source security profiler for iOS, designed to help penetration testers understand what an application does at runtime.</p>
  <h3><a href="https://github.com/iSECPartners/ssl-conservatory">SSL Conservatory</a></h3>
  <p>Correct implementation of SSL is crucial to secure transmission of data between clients and servers. However, this crucial task is frequently done improperly, due to complex APIs and lack of understanding of SSL fundamentals. The SSL Conservatory is intended to be a clearinghouse for well-documented and secure sample code to correctly implement SSL clients.</p>
  <h3><a href="https://github.com/iSECPartners/ios-ssl-kill-switch">iOS SSL Kill Switch</a></h3>
  <p>Blackbox tool to disable SSL certificate validation - including certificate pinning - within iOS Apps. It was presented at the <a href="http://www.blackhat.com/usa/bh-us-12-briefings.html#Diquet">Black Hat USA conference in 2012</a>.</p>
  <h3><a href="https://github.com/iSECPartners/sslyze">SSLyze</a></h3>
  <p>Python tool that can analyze the SSL configuration of a server by connecting to it. It is designed to be fast and comprehensive, and should help organizations and testers identify misconfigurations affecting their SSL servers.</p>
