  <p><i>August 2015 - Black Hat USA 2015</i></p>
  <p>Presentation about a new open-source library that makes it very easy to deploy SSL pinning in iOS or OS X Apps.</p>

  <h3><a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-14/briefings.html#it-just-networks-the-truth-about-ios-7s-multipeer-connectivity-framework">It Just (Net)Works: The Truth About iOS 7's Multipeer Connectivity Framework</a></h3>
  <p><a href="http://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2014kul/speakers/alban-diquet/"><i>October 2014 - Hack in The Box Kuala Lumpur 2014</i></a></p>

  <h1>Projects</h1>

  <h3><a href="https://github.com/datatheorem/TrustKit">TrustKit</a></h3>
  <p>Open source library for "Drag & Drop" SSL pinning in iOS and OS X Apps.</p>

  <h3><a href="https://github.com/nabla-c0d3/sslyze">SSLyze</a></h3>
  <p>Python tool that can analyze the SSL configuration of a server by connecting to it. It is designed to be fast and comprehensive, and should help organizations and testers identify misconfigurations affecting their SSL servers.</p>

  <h3><a href="https://github.com/nabla-c0d3/ssl-kill-switch-2">SSL Kill Switch</a></h3>
  <p>Blackbox tool to disable SSL certificate validation - including certificate pinning - within OS X and iOS Apps. The initial release was presented at the <a href="http://www.blackhat.com/usa/bh-us-12-briefings.html#Diquet">Black Hat USA conference in 2012</a>.</p>

  <h3><a href="https://github.com/nabla-c0d3/ssl-conservatory">SSL Conservatory</a></h3>
  <p>Correct implementation of SSL is crucial to secure transmission of data between clients and servers. However, this crucial task is frequently done improperly, due to complex APIs and lack of understanding of SSL fundamentals. The SSL Conservatory is intended to be a clearinghouse for well-documented and secure sample code to correctly implement SSL clients.</p>

  <h3><a href="http://isecpartners.github.io/Introspy-iOS/">Introspy</a></h3>
  <p>Open-source security profiler for iOS, designed to help penetration testers understand what an application does at runtime.</p>
