A few months ago, [iSEC Partners][isec-blog] performed a security audit of the
[Cryptocat][cryptocat] chat application on iOS. This audit was commissioned by
the (awesome) [Open Technology Fund][otf] and I was the lead tester on this
project.

The final report we delivered was publicly released a week ago by the Cryptocat
project. The document is [available on Hacker News][report-hn], and the
Cryptocat project has also written a [blog post][cryptocat-blog] about some of
the issues we found and what they did to address them.

The iOS application was the main focus of our testing but we also found some
interesting issues affecting the desktop clients. If you're interested in
Cryptocat and/or penetration testing in general, you should definitely [have a
look at the report][report-pdf].
