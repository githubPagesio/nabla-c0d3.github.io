What I thought was the most unexpected thing described in the [MASQUE attack][masque] on iOS was the ability for an App with the same bundle ID, but signed by a different developer identity, to replace the original App already installed on the device; when doing so, [the evil App would then have access the original App's private files][cve-link]!

Among many [other security vulnerabilities][release-notes], Apple fixed this issue with the release of iOS 8.1.3:

> MobileInstallation  
> Available for: iPhone 4s and later, iPod touch (5th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later  
> Impact: A malicious enterprise-signed application may be able to take control of the local container for applications already on a device  
> Description: A vulnerability existed in the application installation process. This was addressed by preventing enterprise applications from overriding existing applications in specific scenarios.

On iOS 8.1.3 if you try to trigger a malicious update, the installation will fail and `mobile_installation_proxy` will return the following error message:

> Upgrade's application-identifier entitlement string (ZRJBFW2XA8.com.package.name) does not match installed application's application-identifier string (G4686YFCAH.com.package.name); rejecting upgrade."

The team ID (which is tied to the developer's signing identity) is now validated to ensure that the old App and the new App use the same one.
