Earlier this week, I was [speaking at the Black Hat US conference][bh-link] in Las Vegas. The topic of my talk was the [Multipeer Connectivity][mc-doc] Framework Apple introduced in iOS 7, which "provides support for discovering services provided by nearby iOS devices [...] and subsequently communicating with those services by sending message-based data, streaming data, and resources (such as files)."
This Framework will also be available on Mac OS X starting with Mac OS X Yosemite, which will be released in a month or so.

The slides for my presentation are now [available for download][slides-pdf].

I will post more information about Multipeer Connectivity on this blog later this week, including things that I did not have time to talk about during the presentation... stay tuned!
