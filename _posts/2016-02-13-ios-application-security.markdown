I was the Technical Reviewer for David Thiel's "iOS Application Security". 

It is now available at [No Starch Press][book-page] and goes in great details on how to spot security issues affecting iOS Apps and how to avoid making these mistakes when building an App; it's a great book!

Get it from [No Starch][book-page]'s website.
