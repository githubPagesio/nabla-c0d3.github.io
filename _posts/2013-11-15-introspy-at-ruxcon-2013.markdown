Last month, Marc Blanchou and myself presented [Introspy][introspy-page] at the [Ruxcon conference][ruxcon-page] in Melbourne, Australia. This presentation describes why we created this tool and how it works. We also did a quick demo of the iOS tool and the Android version (which hasn't been released yet).

* Slides available [here][introspy-slides].
* We were also featured in [SC Magazine][sc-article], which put a video of the presentation on Youtube.
