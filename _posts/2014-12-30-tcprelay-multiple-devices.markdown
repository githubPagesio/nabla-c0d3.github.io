The tcprelay.py and usbmux.py Python scripts from the [usbmuxd project][usbmuxd-gh] make it possible to SSH into an iOS device over USB. This makes it easy to interact with the device without having to rely on WiFi, as described [here][ssh-wiki].

I have modified tcprelay.py to allow forwarding SSH connections to multiple devices connected via USB, instead of just one. The device's udid can be specified using the -u option:

    python tcprelay.py -t 22:5000 -u ddbc43f3247126671d2c7c279723cb2f9f93ace1

 If -u isn't supplied, tcprelay.py will use the first device available.

 See the [project page][project-page] for more details and code.
