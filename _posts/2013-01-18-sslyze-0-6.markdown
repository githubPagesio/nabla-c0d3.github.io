A new version of [SSLyze][sslyze-gh] is now available. SSLyze is a Python tool that can analyze the SSL configuration of a server by connecting to it.
This new version should be more stable/robust and it also brings new features:


### Changelog

* Added support for [Server Name Indication][sni-wiki]; see --sni
* Partial results are returned when the server requires client authentication but no client certificate was provided
* Preliminary IPv6 support
* Various bug fixes and better support of client authentication and HTTPS tunneling


### Download

As usual, three packages are available:

* Linux and OS X: SSLyze v0.6 source package [here][sslyze-dl-src]
* Windows 7 and Python 32 bits: SSLyze v0.6 with OpenSSL 1.0.1c [here][sslyze-dl-win32]
* Windows 7 and Python 64 bits: SSLyze v0.6 with OpenSSL 1.0.1c [here][sslyze-dl-win64]
