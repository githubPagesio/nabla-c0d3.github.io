Earlier today, [Thomas Sileo](https://twitter.com/trucsdedev) and [myself](https://twitter.com/nabla_c0d3) presented at the [Microsoft BlueHat](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/bluehat/2017/09/01/announcing-the-bluehat-v17-schedule/) conference in Redmond.

The title of the talk was "Where, how, and why is SSL traffic on mobile getting intercepted? A look at ten million real-world SSL incidents". This is a research project we've been working for a couple years; we've analyzed pinning failure reports that mobile developers who use [TrustKit](https://github.com/datatheorem/TrustKit) in their apps have shared with us.

So far, we've received about 10 million reports coming from devices all around the world, and we've discussed some of the results of our analysis in this presentation. 

The slides are now available for download [here](/documents/bluehat-2017.pdf).
